    "## Code Injection Attack\n",
    "### Phase 2\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The key technique of exploitation in phase 2 is code injection, which can be carried out in two steps. First, we will write the binary code instructions into the runtime stack. Then, by overflowing the runtime stack, we overwrite the the return address of the current stack and change it into the starting address of the injected code. This way, when the current procedure call is finished, the program will restart at the overwritten return address, which is the injected code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, what we want to achieve with the injection code is to call another procedure named `touch2` with cache as the argument. So, in the injected code, we need to first move the desired argument value for `touch2` into `%rdi%`, the register that by convention holds the first argument for procedure call, and then find some way to call the procedure `touch2`. Because the lab requirement forbids us from using `jmp` or `call` in our injected code, we need to use a combination of stack overflow and `ret` to call `touch2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will place the address of `touch2` in the exploit string. Then, in the injected code, we will manipulate the stack pointer to have it pointing to the injected address of `touch2`. This way, when we call `ret` in the injected code, the stack will pop the address of `touch2` and have the program restart there. as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Execution\n",

    "   0x0000000000401847 <+0>:\tsub    $0x28,%rsp\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to phase 1, because the stack frame is of size `0x28` or `40`, we need to supply 40-byte long exploit string to overflow the stack and then rewrite the return address with another 8 bytes. However, this time, we also need to include the injected code in the first 40 bytes, so we cannot just simply pad them with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we will write down the assembly code we want to inject. The objective of this phase is to call procedure `touch2` with argument `cookie`, whose value is specified in the file `cookie.txt`."
